# Stellar
An Asymetrical Multiplayer Sparcefaring Roguelite

Summary

Starship Game is an asymmetrical co-operative shoot-em up game. Players must work together to ensure the ship survives its voyage through the stars! Each player takes one of 2 roles: the pilot and the mechanic. The pilot must shoot down enemies and avoid hazards while flying through space. Meanwhile, the mechanic has to perform vital functions to ensure the spacecraft is in ship shape, like loading ammunition, implementing upgrades and repairing damage the pilot has sustained in real time. Damage sustained by the pilot and errors made by the mechanic will affect both players. So they must be in sync if they want to survive their stellar odyssey.

Motivation

We love games for its social aspect, so we wanted to make a cooperative game that requires communication between players, so we want to make a game that can foster the same sense of satisfaction that comes from working together. We also love the design of “asymmetrical” multiplayer games like Puyo Puyo Tetris and Dead by Daylight, and wanted to see if we could apply the same concepts in a more cooperative environment.
Through this project, we also hope to gain more experience in the workflow for collaborating on a game development project, and to gain software engineering experience in game development. We also hope to use this as an opportunity to learn the tech stack for making games.

System design and Features

- **Rogue-lite**

    Monsters will be in randomly generated positions and there is an upgrade system that carries on after each run.


- **360 degrees movement of spaceship**

  
    Navigate through an unknown universe with monsters hiding in all directionsof the player. 


- **Co-op player interaction and teamwork**

  
    There are two roles in the spacecraft, the pilot and the technician. The pilot controls the spacecraft, the technician maintains the spacecraft. Both parties have to work together to survive this chaotic universe.


- **Technician minigames**

  
    The technician has multiple tasks, reloading the pilot’s ammo, repairing the spacecraft, and engaging the spacecraft’s shield. Each task requires a different minigame to complete the tasks.


- **Duo screen integration**

  
    The game screen contains the navigation screen for the pilot and the workshop screen for the technician. Both players can do their tasks concurrently on the same screen.

- **Random generated monsters and locations**

  
    Each run will be uniquely different in terms of monsters and loot in the universe. Explore cautiously, no two universes are the same!
